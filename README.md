# 3D_printing
This folder will contain various 3D print designs from the group, for fun, for spare parts and whatever use they might be of. 
No guarantee given for functionality, except that these have been printed and used by us. 
Modify as you like and distribute further. We would be happy to recieve updated designs ourselves too!

We use a Prusa i3 MK3S printer, plus the PrusaSlicer software. In the Manuals_SOPs folder you can find some tips and tricks how to get started with your own 3D models even from own structural data using PyMOL.
